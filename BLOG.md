What do I need to communicate?

 1. That we care about the quality of our tools.
    A. Some things are not possible without good tools.
    B. Bad tools, or lack of tools, causes incredible and often invisible friction.
 2. That the search team relies heavily on good load testing tools.
    A. Automated integration testing.
    B. Performance testing of new binaries.
    C. Performance testing of new indexes.
    D. Performance tuning.
    E. Test to failure.
 3. That a good load tester has a lot of necessary qualities.
    A. (see other doc).
 4. That the core of a good load tester requires the use of asynchronous I/O, which can be very
    painful to program against.
    A. There are a few different approaches (list them out).
 5. That we need a load tester for a number of different protocols (part of 3?).
 6. That we use load testing for a wide variety of different use cases.
    A. (see other doc)
 7. That we use Quasar because it has high performance async I/O and a nice programming interface.
 8. That tuning the JVM and the server is very important, and challenging.
    A. Go through the actual tuning we did for the echo service.
 9. That libraries are better than frameworks.
 10. That we have compared the performance of Go and Java for load testing.
 11. We are moving from a monolithic ball-of-mud to a service oriented architecture.
